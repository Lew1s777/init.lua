Troublem shooting
---
- If vim suddenly becomes jammed, try running the following command in shell.
```
rm ~/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada
```


- Remove folder ```ï„• plugin``` if it cause error.Packer will regenerate this folder.

- Use command below to debug keymap issues
```
:verbose map <the map have issue>
```

Tips

- If you use root permission,you can create a link to ```/root/.config.nvim``` so that you won't have two copy of config file and your changes will directly apply to root user.
